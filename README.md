Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.

### Install from this repository ###
In this repository, I add `mil_layer` and `mil_data_layer` for multi-instance learning problem. 

Here I added my own `Makefile.config`(If you use repository, you need to modify this file to suite your need).
I install the file using the following command: 
```bash 
# cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
# Adjust Makefile.config (for example, if using Anaconda Python, or if cuDNN is desired)
make all
make test
make runtest
```
To compile the Python and MATLAB wrappers do `make pycaffe` and `make matcaffe` respectively. *Be sure to set your MATLAB and Python paths in Makefile.config first!*

###Some useful tutorials in caffe###
0. draw net using python:
```python python/draw_net.py examples/net_surgery/conv.prototxt my_net.png```
1. net surgery tutorials.
2. extract features in caffe.
3. more to be added.
